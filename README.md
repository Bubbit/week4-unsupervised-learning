# ML Challenge Week 4 - Unsupervised Learning

In *unsupervised learning*, as you might guess, the training data is unlabeled. The system tries to learn without a teacher.

Here are some of the most important unsupervised learning algorithms:

* Clustering
  - K-Means
  - DBSCAN
  - Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)
* Anomaly detection and novelty detection
  - One-class SVM
  - Isolation Forest
* Visualization and dimensionality reduction
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - Kernel PCA
  - Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)
  - t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
* Association rule learning
  - Apriori
  - Eclat
